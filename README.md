## ***`Instructions`***

visit either of the offical links below, or click the green "Code" button and download the .ZIP. next, open up ur file manager and right click on the .ZIP before clicking "Extract All". from there just navagate to the new folder and open index.html to open the Helios Browser locally in your browser! this file can not be blocked unless your admin physically deletes the file off of your device, so i recomend doing this.

## ***`𝙾𝚟𝚎𝚛𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚠`***

this is the orgignal Helios proxy slapped together soley by me, dinguschan. its a web browser proxy thing i whipped up while absolutly zonked out of my goose, and its in NO way finished. the aim is to be a replacement for dingusProxy, a replacement for your spyware ridden admin controlled browser, and just a plain better proxy than anything any skiddy ass anti censorship "networks" on the internet could cook up. the idea for this was to expand upon dingusProxy's specialized static host, clientside, local, and html css js only web proxy code and unfuck the mess of code in there. i added sandboxed tabs, specialized settings and cloaking, built in threat protection and- I JUST WANNA TO CLONE CHROME. I WANNA BLATENTLY COPY CHROME SOOOOO FUCKING BAD. ITS GONNA BE 𝘽𝙀𝙏𝙏𝙀𝙍 ITS GONNA BE 𝙁𝘼𝙎𝙏𝙀𝙍 ITS GONNA TAKE YOUR ADMINS SHITASS CENSORSHIP AND FUCK. IT. UP. BEAT THAT SHIT DOWN WITH A RUSTY STEEL PIPE WRENCH MADE OF DINGUSCHAN CERTIFIED BOMB ASS CODE.
